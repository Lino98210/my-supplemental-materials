Wild, Low-quanlity Bullets, Ebb Tide:
These three songs were collectively created by the members of the Fancy Wall Band. 
I worked as a drummer in the band, mainly responsible for the arrangement of drum beats and the arrangement and cohesion of the entire song. 
In 2016, with the addition of new band members, we changed the original youthful music style and gave birth to these three songs, which are also my favorite in our ten cities tour in the summer of 2018. 
These three songs were created during rehearsal. First, our guitarist gave a riff, and then I tried some drum beats. 
After determining the framework of the verse and chorus, I then perfected the connection between the next phrase and the phrase, and finally fill in the words.

MIMF:
In collecting data, after realizing the sensor's problems and the real worldâ€™s complex challenges to the autonomous driving task, my colleagues and I decided to provide another method to solve this problem. 
We designed a weight-fusion module based on mutual information (MI) and integrated it into our feature fusion lane line segmentation network. 
I was assigned to design the network framework and examined the model on the LIDAR-camera fusion lane line segmentation task on the KITTI and A2D2 datasets.
